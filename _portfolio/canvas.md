A demo application inspired to [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/), but with minimal functionalities and that can be executed offline.  

The application provides a blank canvas for the execution of OpenGL fragment shaders. The shader provides access to the UV coordinates of the screen and to a time variable, and the application allows for a reloading of the shader in real time.  

The project can be found on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/filthynobleman/shader-canvas).
