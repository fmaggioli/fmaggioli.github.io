Adjunct professor in charge of the undergrad course on *Computer Architecture*.  

Course Abstract
===============
This course delves into the design and functioning of computer systems from both low-level and structural perspectives. Topics include instruction set architectures (MIPS), data representation (positional systems, two’s complement), assembly-level programming (arithmetic, logic, memory access, control flow, function calls), and floating-point formats (IEEE 754). Hardware design modules cover digital logic (gates, multiplexers, decoders), arithmetic units (ALUs), sequential circuits (latches, flip‑flops), and control units. The curriculum culminates in pipelined CPU implementation, performance evaluation, and memory hierarchy optimization strategies such as caches, multicore processors, and GPUs.
