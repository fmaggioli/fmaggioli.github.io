## Abstract
Real-time procedural texturing is becoming more and more important as the need of large variety of contents increases. We propose a new technique that exploits the properties of a 4-dimensional algebraic field for efficiently computing on GPU a procedural texture with fractal properties. The produced pattern are shown to be well suitable in many applications, especially when used as building blocks for complex materials.
