A MATLAB implementation for the FEM discretization of the Laplace-Beltrami operator for triangular meshes that is not limited to linear approximations.  

The code implements the technique described in the paper *Finite element approximation of the Laplaceâ€“Beltrami operator on a surface with boundary* (E. Burman et al.) and allows the discretization of the LBO for any polynomial order.  

The project can be found on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/filthynobleman/FEM-laplacian).
