A demo application for generating heightmaps using a classical Perlin noise + Voronoi diagram approach.  

The application also procedurally generates the bed of a river running from north to south and generates an inclination in the terrain. This can be useful if one would like to use a generated terrain for physical simulations, for instance.

The project can be found on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/filthynobleman/river-generator).
