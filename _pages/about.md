I currently am a Tenured Assistant Professor at Pegaso University, in the Department of Information Science and Technology.
Previously, I was an Adjunct Professor at Pegaso University, and a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Milano-Bicocca, under the supervision of Prof. Simone Melzi. I have also been a Postdoctoral Researcher in the GLADIA group at Sapienza – University of Rome, under the supervision of Prof. Emanuele Rodolà, and a Research Intern in the Computational Sciences group at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, under the supervision of Prof. Dominik L. Michels.  
I have obtained my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 2019 at Sapienza – University of Rome, where he also defended his Ph.D. thesis on “Scalable Geometry Processing for Computer Graphics Applications” in 2023.  

My research activity is in the fields of Computer Graphics and Computer Vision, with a particular focus on Geometry Processing, Computational Geometry, Shape Analysis, and Spectral Geometry. I also have other research interests, spanning the fields of Physical Simulations and Parallel Computing.
